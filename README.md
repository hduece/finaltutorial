**Project Plan:** 

As partners (Hailey Dusablon and Jordan Stein), we are interested in exploring socioeconomic factors that may be correlated to health issues. 
Since we are both interested in careers in the healthcare field, analyzing this type of data would be a great opportunity to gain some insight 
into how lifestyle factors may affect the health of populations. This type of research is important because lifestyle choices can be changed, 
so it is useful to know how our everyday actions can impact our health. The first dataset we are interested in analyzing is the COVID Data Tracker 
published by the CDC (which can be found here: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home). This dataset contains information 
related to the prevalence of covid cases, deaths, and trends at the national, state, and county levels in the United States. More specifically, 
this dataset contains information regarding the state-wide distribution of people who have received the COVID vaccine. One question that would be 
interesting to explore with this data is how socioeconomic factors, such as poverty and minority group distribution, affect the spread of covid and 
the vaccination rates in different states and counties. We would also like to see if the regions with lower rates of the covid vaccine also have 
lower rates of other types of common vaccines. Since there is a significant stigma surrounding the COVID vaccine, it would be interesting to see 
how the COVID vaccine rates compare to other vaccine rates. Lastly, we could compare the covid trends in the United States to trends in other 
countries by including some research about how other health officials handled the spread of the virus, and this may be useful for looking at 
socioeconomic factors since they will likely differ depending on the country. We are considering this research because COVID has been a very 
relevant problem for the past year and a half and the COVID vaccine has been very controversial. We have not seen a lot of covid research 
studying social factors such as religion, access to healthcare resources, and income. It would be interesting to single out a few of these 
factors and see if any of them are related to covid trends. 
Another dataset that could  be interesting to look at is from https://www.kaggle.com/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data. This dataset looks at several 
predicting factors for heart disease, such as age, gender, resting blood pressure, and cholesterol. Similar to the COVID Tracker dataset, we think it 
would be interesting to look at social factors such as occupation, income, and diet that may be correlated to heart disease. A lot of websites discuss 
how lifestyle factors such as healthy diets and exercise can reduce heart rate, so it would be interesting to analyze these factors first-hand and see 
how heavily they correlate to heart disease. We could also analyze other datasets to see if individuals with heart disease may be more prone to developing 
other diseases or disorders. After exploring multiple data sets, it was obvious that a lot of research regarding medical problems only explored medical 
issues and did not address any social factors that may be correlated to the health-related problems. Another component of this research may include 
analyzing the lifestyle choices of certain regions or countries with the lowest rates of heart disease and comparing those lifestyle choices to areas 
with the highest rates of heart disease. As heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, this is a very prevalent medical issue and 
research like this can help educate people about how their everyday decisions can affect their health. 

**Collaboration Plan:**

To begin the project, we started by setting up a Github repository and ensuring that we were both listed as collaborators. Since the 
website was created with Haileyâ€™s account, Jordan cloned the repository on her computer. After this website was established, we met on 
Zoom to discuss datasets we were interested in exploring and possible ideas about how we would analyze these datasets. For future 
collaboration, we are planning to meet twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays for two hours each day via Zoom or in-person and will 
be coordinating code through a private Github repository. 

**Challenges with Obtaining Data: **

The biggest challenge in creating the dataframe was deciding how to tidy and reformat the data. We decided it would be best to drop the 
columns that we would not need for our research purposes. We dropped any columns that had information regarding the number of vaccines 
delivered to each state, since we are only interested in looking at the number of vaccines that were administered to populations. We 
dropped columns all columns that had information about different age groups (over 18 and under 12), but we kept the column with information 
about the 65+ age group because older populations are at a significantly higher risk for being infected. Lastly, we dropped all the columns 
about the booster vaccine since the data was only available at a national level (because the booster vaccine was only developed very recently). 
Another challenge in starting this project was learning how to navigate GitHub. It took a bit of trial-and-error to figure out how to organize 
our information on the site. Now, we are more familiar and comfortable with using GitHub.
